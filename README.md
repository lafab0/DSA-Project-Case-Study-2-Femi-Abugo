DSA Project Case Study 2 is for Case Study 2: Kultra Mega Stores Inventory.

The company overview : Kultra Mega Stores (KMS), headquartered in Lagos, specialises in office supplies and
furniture. Its customer base includes individual consumers, small businesses (retail), and
large corporate clients (wholesale) across Lagos, Nigeria.
I am engaged as a Business Intelligence Analyst to support the Abuja division of
KMS. The Business Manager shared an Excel file containing order data from 2009 to
2012 and requested that I analyze the data and present mh key insights and
findings, thereby presenting two scenarios to the case study.

# PROJECT STEPS
Applying my SQL skills from the DSA Data Analysis class, tasks were actioned to solve both case scenarios
as shared in the document. 
1. Using SQL Server Managemeng studio, a database was created and data provided imported as a table into the database.
2. Data was cleaned and data type was optimised in the process.
   * Sales, Profit, Discount, Shipping_Cost changed to DECIMAL(10,2)
   * Quantity, Order_ID, Product Count changed to INT
4. The business questions were analysed to assist in providing management decisions and insights generated from the SQL queries written to ptovide amswers go ghe business questions.
