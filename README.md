DSA Project Case Study 2 is for Case Study 2: Kultra Mega Stores Inventory.

The company overview : Kultra Mega Stores (KMS), headquartered in Lagos, specialises in office supplies and
furniture. Its customer base includes individual consumers, small businesses (retail), and
large corporate clients (wholesale) across Lagos, Nigeria.
I am engaged as a Business Intelligence Analyst to support the Abuja division of
KMS. The Business Manager shared an Excel file containing order data from 2009 to
2012 and requested that I analyze the data and present mh key insights and
findings, thereby presenting two scenarios to the case study.
